# HoloKernel

A next-generation operating system kernel featuring holographic memory management and advanced entity-based architecture.

## 🚀 Overview

HoloKernel is an experimental kernel that implements innovative holographic memory management concepts, providing a unique approach to system resource allocation and entity management. The kernel is designed with modularity and extensibility in mind, featuring a clean separation between different system entities.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Holographic Memory Management**: Advanced memory allocation using holographic dimensions (512x512 matrix)
- **Entity-Based Architecture**: Modular design with CPU, Memory, Device, and Filesystem entities
- **Cross-Platform Build System**: Automated compilation with GitHub Actions
- **Local Dependency Management**: Self-contained build environment with no external downloads
- **32-bit i686 Target**: Optimized for x86 architecture
- **QEMU Testing Ready**: Fully bootable kernel image for virtualization testing

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

- **Boot Loader** (`boot.asm`): Initial system bootstrap and kernel loading with protected mode transition
- **Kernel Entry** (`kernel_entry.asm`): Assembly entry point and system initialization
- **Main Kernel** (`holographic_kernel.c`): Core kernel implementation with holographic memory management
- **Linker Script** (`linker.ld`): Memory layout and section organization

### Entity System

The kernel implements four primary entity types:
- `ENTITY_CPU`: Processor management and scheduling
- `ENTITY_MEMORY`: Holographic memory allocation and management
- `ENTITY_DEVICE`: Hardware device abstraction
- `ENTITY_FILESYSTEM`: File system operations and storage

## 🛠️ Quick Installation Guide

### Prerequisites
- Ubuntu/Debian-based Linux system
- Internet connection for package downloads
- At least 1GB free disk space

### One-Command Installation
```bash
# Update system and install all required packages
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y gcc-multilib nasm qemu-system-x86 wget make
```

### Step-by-Step Setup
```bash
# 1. Create project directory
mkdir holokernel_project && cd holokernel_project

# 2. Download the 5 core files
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rainmanp7/holokernel/main/boot.asm
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rainmanp7/holokernel/main/holographic_kernel.c
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rainmanp7/holokernel/main/Makefile
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rainmanp7/holokernel/main/linker.ld
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rainmanp7/holokernel/main/kernel_entry.asm

# 3. Build the kernel
make clean && make all

# 4. Test with QEMU
timeout 30 qemu-system-x86_64 -drive format=raw,file=emergeos.img -m 256 -nographic -serial mon:stdio
```

### Required Packages
- **gcc-multilib**: Cross-platform C compiler with 32-bit support
- **nasm**: Netwide Assembler for x86 assembly code
- **qemu-system-x86**: x86 system emulator for kernel testing
- **make**: Build automation tool
- **wget**: File download utility

**Note**: No dedicated cross-compiler required - uses standard gcc with multilib support.

## 🧪 Testing & Verification

### Success Indicators
- Build completes without errors
- `emergeos.img` file is created (bootable kernel image)
- QEMU boots and shows kernel initialization messages
- No kernel panic or hang during boot process

### Troubleshooting
- **Build Issues**: Ensure all 5 files downloaded correctly, verify gcc-multilib installation
- **Boot Issues**: Increase QEMU memory (`-m 512`), use `-serial mon:stdio` for debugging
- **File Issues**: Check that `emergeos.img` was created successfully

## 🏗️ Advanced Building

### Prerequisites (Advanced)

The project includes a complete cross-compilation toolchain that builds automatically:
- **NASM** (Netwide Assembler) for assembly code
- **Binutils** (i686-elf) for linking and object manipulation
- **GCC** (i686-elf) for C compilation

### Local Build (Advanced)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rainmanp7/holokernel.git
cd holokernel

# Build using the standard makefile
make

# Or use the modified makefile for native tools
make -f makefile.modified
```

### Remote Build (GitHub Actions)

The project includes automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions:
- Automatic cross-compiler toolchain setup
- Kernel compilation and linking
- Build artifact generation
- Caching for improved build times
