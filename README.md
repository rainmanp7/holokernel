# HoloKernel

A next-generation operating system kernel featuring holographic memory management and advanced entity-based architecture.

## 🚀 Overview

HoloKernel is an experimental kernel that implements innovative holographic memory management concepts, providing a unique approach to system resource allocation and entity management. The kernel is designed with modularity and extensibility in mind, featuring a clean separation between different system entities.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Holographic Memory Management**: Advanced memory allocation using holographic dimensions (512x512 matrix)
- **Entity-Based Architecture**: Modular design with CPU, Memory, Device, and Filesystem entities
- **Cross-Platform Build System**: Automated compilation with GitHub Actions
- **Local Dependency Management**: Self-contained build environment with no external downloads
- **32-bit i686 Target**: Optimized for x86 architecture

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

- **Boot Loader** (`boot.asm`): Initial system bootstrap and kernel loading
- **Kernel Entry** (`kernel_entry.asm`): Assembly entry point and system initialization
- **Main Kernel** (`holographic_kernel.c`): Core kernel implementation with holographic memory management
- **Linker Script** (`linker.ld`): Memory layout and section organization

### Entity System

The kernel implements four primary entity types:
- `ENTITY_CPU`: Processor management and scheduling
- `ENTITY_MEMORY`: Holographic memory allocation and management
- `ENTITY_DEVICE`: Hardware device abstraction
- `ENTITY_FILESYSTEM`: File system operations and storage

## 🛠️ Building

### Prerequisites

The project includes a complete cross-compilation toolchain that builds automatically:
- **NASM** (Netwide Assembler) for assembly code
- **Binutils** (i686-elf) for linking and object manipulation
- **GCC** (i686-elf) for C compilation

### Local Build

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rainmanp7/holokernel.git
cd holokernel

# Build using the standard makefile
make

# Or use the modified makefile for native tools
make -f makefile.modified
```

### Remote Build (GitHub Actions)

The project includes automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions:
- Automatic cross-compiler toolchain setup
- Kernel compilation and linking
- Build artifact generation
- Caching for improved build times

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit issues, feature requests, or pull requests.

### Development Guidelines

1. **Code Style**: Follow the existing code style and architecture patterns
2. **Testing**: Test builds locally before submitting PRs using both makefiles
3. **Documentation**: Update documentation for new features and architectural changes
4. **Compatibility**: Ensure compatibility with the i686-elf target architecture
5. **Commit Messages**: Use clear, descriptive commit messages following conventional commits

### Getting Started with Development

```bash
# Fork and clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/holokernel.git
cd holokernel

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make your changes and test
make clean && make

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Build Issues

- **Cross-compiler not found**: Ensure the toolchain is built using GitHub Actions or manually
- **Memory allocation errors**: Check that target memory addresses don't conflict
- **Assembly linking issues**: Verify NASM version compatibility and syntax

### Getting Help

- Open an [issue](https://github.com/rainmanp7/holokernel/issues) for bugs or questions
- Check existing issues for similar problems
- Review the build logs in GitHub Actions for detailed error information
